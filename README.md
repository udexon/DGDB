Decentralized Graph Database


- Free software revolution 1.0: Decentralization of Code
- Free software revolution 1.5: Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies
- Free software revolution 2.0: Decentralization of Data

Get search results in a web spreadsheet, which itself is programmable.

There are at least 3 fundamental paradigm shifts that are required to make this happen -- graph database, decentralized user authentication, hybrid programming language API -- which may explain why it has not been achieved so far, as the likelihood of finding someone or a group of programmers mastering all 3 fields would be infinitesimal.

It takes a finite time t0 for programmer P0 to convince programmer P1 to believe in this vision, to be called Phosway. Let t_i be the time taken for programmer P_i to convince programmer P_{i+1}. So we hope that t_i < t_{i+1} is true.
When i is small, P_i will be affected by trends in computer programming, more likely to choose to dismiss Phosway rather than believing in it.



## Graph Database

- A json file is part of a graph database.

This is the first paradigm shift and practical understanding that we wish to impart in order to convince programmers they can contribute to something bigger than MAGA+F.
Academics would not be interested in this debate. 



What only MAGA+F can do in-house, all programmers can do now, producing MAGA+F clones, and better.

Chances of success of similar projects? How did their teams grow?

 
## II: Decentralized User Authentication
The term "decentralized" has been "hijacked and abused" by blockchain advocates in the past few years with some notable, but limited, progress. We adopted this term largely due to the fact that our framework has a common root with blockchain in asymmetric cryptography, and it modifies significantly one of the most fundamental step in network computing: user authentication.


## III: Hybrid Programming Language API

Universal interface script
